# 🚗 Car Price Prediction API

This project is a **Machine Learning-powered API** built using **FastAPI** to predict the selling price of a used car based on its characteristics.

---

## 📦 Project Features

- 🔐 **Authentication**: JWT-based token auth and API key validation
- 🧠 **ML Model Prediction**: Trained model predicts used car prices
- ⚡ **Redis Caching**: Avoid redundant model computation
- 📈 **Monitoring Ready**: Prometheus metrics + Grafana dashboards
- 🐳 **Dockerized Setup**: Simplified deployment with Docker Compose
- ☁️ **Cloud Deployment**: Easily deploy to [Render](https://render.com)
